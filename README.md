## About Omnifood

The purpose of this project was to test my skills with HTML5 & CSS3. Part of this practice included building the architecture of the site using CSS Grid and Flexbox depending on which section fitted the criteria. This was my first time using front-end code for quite some time, so I wanted to experiment to see what worked best for me.

The purpose of the website itself is to prioritise well-being by promoting healthy eating habits. Therefore, by preparing and delivering freshly prepared meals to selected cities via an affordable monthly subscription service, users will recieve one or two meals per days on affordable subscription plans, making healthy eating convenient and accessible.
