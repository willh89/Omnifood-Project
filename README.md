## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project was to become familiar and comfortable using SASS to compile and organise CSS.

It also helped me understand more advanced CSS techniques such as animation, how to scale or rotate images using the transform property, as well as the pre-requisites needed to ensure websites are responsive, browser compatible, and accessible.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
